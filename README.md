We Are the World

## project overview
For this project I will be focusing on some parts of the lyrics from the song: "We are the World" by Michael Jackson. The reason I chose this song is because it has an important message about equality in the community of America. Although I heard a similar song to support Haiti, I listen to Michael Jackson's song and I know that they are the same song. Part of the lyrics I chose are: "We are the world", 
"We are the children","We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving.""It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me", "But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall", and "So let's start giving".  That'll show everyone what it means to be equal. 

## technical overview
I will input some codes on some words using the hover and transform command in the stylesheet to make some important words that represent equality through some animation. 

# acknowledgment
I firmly believe that all men are equal no matter how different we are. I truly understand that though there are some racism in this world, everyone should be reminded that we are not so different when we look at each other closely.
