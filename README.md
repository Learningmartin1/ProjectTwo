We Are the World

## project overview
The song I choose for this project is "We are the World" by Michael Jackson. The reason I chose this song is because it has an important message about equality in the community. Although I heard a similar song to support Haiti, I listen to Michael Jackson's song and I know that they are the same song. For this project, I will choose some parts of the lyrics whic are: "We are the world", "It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me", "But if you just believe, there's no way we can fall", "And so we all must lend a helping hand", and "We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving." That'll show everyone what it means to be equal.

## technical overview
I will input some codes on some words using the hover and transform command in the stylesheet to make some important words that represent equality through some animation. 

# acknowledgment
I firmly believe that all men are equal no matter how different we are. I truly understand that though there are some racism in this world, everyone should be reminded that we are not so different when we look at each other closely.
